              <p className="mb-4">
                Founded in 2018, Culinary Sciences Inc. (CSI) was born from a vision to revolutionize how the food industry approaches Rapid Chilling and Food Treatment. Our founders, with decades of experience in engineering and culinary arts, identified a critical gap in the market: traditional methods were inefficient, inconsistent, and compromised food quality.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                What began as an experimental prototype in a small workshop has evolved into a suite of groundbreaking Extreme Vacuum Cooling (EVC) technologies that are transforming food operations across restaurants, food manufacturers, and agricultural businesses worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission is simple: to develop and deliver innovative, IP-protected technologies that dramatically enhance food quality and flavor, extend shelf life, reduce energy consumption, and create more sustainable food systems. Through continuous research and development, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in rapid-chilling and food treatment.
